# Mistakepack
A Minecraft texturepack that features a ton of things. But it's flawed by design.  
Please don't use this. It's designed to brag about how horrbile it is. It is just.. not good. And I need version control. That's why this has a repo.  

### Contributing
We do accept contributions and they are greatly welcomed! Just make sure that whatever contribution you make, it isn't a good one. We accept the addition of swapped, horrible or plain unrelated new textures for objects, aswell as language and splashes updates.

### Credits
I dont really know man. Its just everything off of Google Images. If you exist, you can probably sue me.
